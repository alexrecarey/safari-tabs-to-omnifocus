*AppleScript to export current Safari tabs to OmniFocus inbox items*

## About

Converts each tab in the frontmost window of Safari into an OmniFocus inbox item.

The OmniFocus action title is set to the tab title, and the notes field contains the tab URL.

## Why?

I have a few "Todo" folders in Safari â€” blog posts to read, videos to watch. In Safari they sit there forever and rot. If I can get them into OmniFocus, I can prioritize actually reading and watching them.

Another use case: you're researching a topic `X` and have tons of tabs open to read. Something comes up and you need to move on. However, you need to come back to finish this later. Rather than save tabs in Safari, export them with this script, then put the actions into a new project, "Research topic `X`".
